                        <p>Golconda Fort (Telugu: Gollakonda, lit. "shepherds' hill"), is a fortified citadel built by
                            the
                            Qutb Shahi dynasty (c. 1321-1687) as the capital of the Golconda Sultanate, located in
                            Hyderabad, Telangana, India. Because of the vicinity of diamond mines, especially Kollur
                            Mine,
                            Golconda flourished as a trade centre of large diamonds, known as the Golconda Diamonds. The
                            region has produced some of the world's most famous diamonds, including the colourless
                            Koh-i-Noor (now owned by the United Kingdom), the blue Hope (United States), the pink
                            Daria-i-Noor (Iran), the white Regent (France), the Dresden Green (Germany), and the
                            colourless
                            Orlov (Russia), Nizam and Jacob (India), as well as the now lost diamonds Florentine Yellow,
                            Akbar Shah and Great Mogul.

                            The complex was put by UNESCO on its "tentative list" to become a World Heritage Site in
                            2014,
                            with others in the region, under the name Monuments and Forts of the Deccan Sultanate
                            (despite
                            there being a number of different sultanates).[1]</p>
